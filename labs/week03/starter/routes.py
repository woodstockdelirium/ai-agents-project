"""The five routes, their definitions, and the two prompts. TODO 1 and 4.

Write the definitions before you write any code. This is not a style
preference, it is the difference between a measurement and a coincidence.

If the boundary between a status chase and a request is not written down
before the prompt is written, then your prompt and the gold labels disagree
in a way neither of you has noticed, and the accuracy number you produce is
measuring the gap between your definitions and ours rather than the quality
of your classifier. You will not be able to tell those two apart afterwards.

#
# Two pieces of advice, both of which cost people marks every year.
#
# Define each route by what the help desk is expected to DO, not by what the
# message feels like. "The sender is annoyed" is not a route: a request can
# be furious and a complaint can be perfectly polite. Tone is a property of
# the writing. The route is a property of the work.
#
# `other` still needs a real definition even though it means "everything
# else". A route defined only by exclusion is where a classifier hides its
# failures, and you will not find them at the checkpoint.
#
# You may disagree with the definitions in queries.py. If you do, that is a
# legitimate choice and it has a consequence: your accuracy is then measured
# against labels produced under a different convention. Decide deliberately
# and write the decision in DECISIONS.md.
