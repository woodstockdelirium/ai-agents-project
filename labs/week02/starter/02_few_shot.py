"""Block 3. The few-shot variant, and the honest comparison.

    python 02_few_shot.py --replay
    python 02_few_shot.py

Same schema, same scorer, same ten documents. One variable changes, which is
the presence of examples. That is the whole experimental design, and it is
the part most student comparisons get wrong.

Two ways to break it, both easy and both fatal:

  * editing the schema or the scorer between the two runs, which makes the
    two numbers incomparable
  * taking examples from DOCS, which turns the second measurement into a
    memory test. Examples come from EXAMPLE_POOL, which is held out for
    exactly this reason.

Two TODO markers.

    #   a. Which fields moved, and which did not move at all? Do not report
    #      one overall number. The interesting content is that they do not
    #      move together.
    #
    #   b. Did any field get WORSE? If one did, say which and diagnose it.

    #      the one students skip past looking for a win.

    #      became a different wrong label is not a fix. Look at the failure
    #      lines, not just the counts.

    #      your mind. "It scored higher" is not sufficient on ten records,
